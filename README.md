## Welcome to my page! (Under construction)

Finally I decide to set up a website myself after getting a lot of help from other amazing blogs. This will be a place of sharing the fun of statistics, machine learning and some explanatory website building experience. 

My Chinese blog is [Here](http://devotiondian.tumblr.com/) to share life thoughts and random literatures.
